The region&#8217;s towering old-growth forests, alpine meadows, and rushing rivers are also sites of ongoing struggles over colonialism, Indigenous sovereignty, and resource extraction. On each Reconnect Earth trip <strong>we&#8217;ll explore what it means to work for social justice and environmental sustainability on contested land, while experiencing some of the most spectacular landscapes in the Pacific Northwest. <img class=\"  wp-image-165 alignright\" src=\"https://reconnectearth.local/app/uploads/2018/09/p1110952.jpg\" alt=\"P1110952\" width=\"259\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://reconnectearth.local/app/uploads/2018/09/p1110952.jpg 2448w, https://reconnectearth.local/app/uploads/2018/09/p1110952-225x300.jpg 225w, https://reconnectearth.local/app/uploads/2018/09/p1110952-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Reconnect Earth is offering trips during two sets of dates in Summer 2019:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>June 24th &#8211; July 1st (trip full)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>August 19th &#8211; August 26th (space still available!) </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of our low overhead we are able to offer trips at a significantly lower cost than comparable backpacking experiences. Tuition for an eight-day Reconnect Earth trip is $450, <strong>with scholarships available</strong> for those for whom this is a genuine financial hardship (you&#8217;ll have the chance to submit a scholarship request as part of the application process). <strong>The first step to joining a trip is to fill out our application form.</strong> <a href=\"https://fs3.formsite.com/t1Jnpr/eop3ammwbx/index.html\"><strong>Apply now.</strong></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Reconnect Earth&#8217;s summer trips are open to college students and other self-identified young adults ages 18 and up. Our trips will <strong>engage your mind as much as your body</strong> as we travel up steep mountains and down into glacial valleys while re-conceptualizing our relationships with the land in ways you may never have imagined. No prior hiking or backpacking experience is needed to participate and we are committed to supporting participants with special needs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Sound like your kind of adventure? <a href=\"https://fs3.formsite.com/t1Jnpr/eop3ammwbx/index.html\"><strong>Apply here</strong></a> and we&#8217;ll follow up with you soon.
